    "based on their highest probability of chosen class as the output.If we have trained a few classifiers, each one achieving about \n",
    "80% accuracy.You may have a Logistic Regression classifier, an SVM classifier, a Random Forest classifier, a K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "classifier, and perhaps a few more . A very simple way to create an even better classifier is to aggregate the predictions of \n",
    "each classifier and predict the class that gets the most votes. This majority-vote classifier is called a hard voting classifier.\n",
    "Somewhat surprisingly, this voting classifier often achieves a higher accuracy than the best classifier in the ensemble. \n",
    "In fact, even if each classifier is a weak learner (meaning it does only slightly better than random guessing), the ensemble \n",
    "can still be a strong learner (achieving high accuracy), provided there are a sufficient number of weak learners and they are \n",
    "sufficiently diverse. Voting Classifier supports two types of votings:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Hard Voting: In hard voting, the predicted output class is a class with the highest majority of votes i.e the class which had \n",
    "    the highest probability of being predicted by each of the classifiers. Suppose three classifiers predicted the output \n",
    "    class(A, A, B), so here the majority predicted A as output. Hence A will be the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soft Voting: In soft voting, the output class is the prediction based on the average of probability given to that class. \n",
    "    Suppose given some input to three models, the prediction probability for class A = (0.30, 0.47, 0.53) and \n",
    "    B = (0.20, 0.32, 0.40). So the average for class A is 0.4333 and B is 0.3067, the winner is clearly class \n",
